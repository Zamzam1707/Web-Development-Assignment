<!-- Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with example. -->

Absolute Positioning:

With absolute positioning, an element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block (usually the browser window).
The element is taken out of the normal flow of the document, meaning it does not affect the position of other elements.
You can use the top, bottom, left, and right properties to specify the exact position of the element.

Relative Positioning:

Relative positioning allows you to position an element relative to its normal position within the document flow.
The element still occupies its original space in the document, but you can use the top, bottom, left, and right properties to adjust its position relative to where it would normally be.
Other elements in the document flow are not affected by a relatively positioned element.

Sticky Positioning:

Sticky positioning is a hybrid between relative and fixed positioning.
The element is initially positioned according to the normal flow of the document, but it becomes fixed (like position: fixed) once it reaches a specified scroll position.
Sticky positioning is often used for creating sticky headers or sidebars that remain visible as the user scrolls the page.

Fixed Positioning:

With fixed positioning, an element is positioned relative to the browser window, regardless of scrolling.
The element is removed from the normal document flow and remains fixed at its specified position.
Commonly used for elements like fixed navigation bars or overlays that should always remain in the same position on the screen.
