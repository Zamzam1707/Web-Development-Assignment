<!-- What’s Grid & Flex and difference between them? -->

	Grid and Flexbox are two CSS layout systems that provide powerful capabilities for creating responsive and flexible layouts. While they both serve similar purposes, they have different approaches and are suited for different use cases.

Flexbox:
Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, is a one-dimensional layout system that focuses on arranging elements in a row or a column. It provides an easy way to create flexible and dynamic layouts, especially for building components like navigation bars, flexible content containers, or vertically aligned elements.

Key features of Flexbox:


•	One-dimensional: Flexbox operates in a single dimension either horizontally or vertically.
•	Flex container and flex items: The parent element becomes a flex container by applying display: flex, and the child elements within it become flex items.
•	Flexibility: Flexbox provides flexible resizing and alignment options for the flex items, allowing them to expand, shrink, and adjust their size based on available space.
•	Main and cross axis: Flexbox operates along two axes - main axis (horizontal or vertical) and cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis).
•	Alignment and ordering: Flexbox offers powerful alignment and ordering properties to control the alignment, spacing, and order of flex items.
Grid:
CSS Grid Layout, commonly known as Grid, is a two-dimensional layout system that enables precise control over both rows and columns. It allows for creating complex grid-based layouts with ease, making it suitable for creating overall page layouts, responsive grids, and grid-based designs.

Key features of Grid:


•	Two-dimensional: Grid operates in both rows and columns simultaneously, allowing for complex grid-based layouts.
•	Grid container and grid items: The parent element becomes a grid container by applying display: grid, and the child elements within it become grid items.
•	Grid tracks and grid cells: Grid defines a grid structure using rows and columns, forming grid tracks, and each cell within the grid is a grid cell.
•	Explicit positioning: Grid provides fine-grained control over the placement and sizing of grid items through explicit positioning using grid lines and grid areas.
•	Alignment and spanning: Grid offers powerful alignment and spanning capabilities, allowing for easy control over item placement and spanning multiple grid cells.
