<!-- Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ? -->
4.	Inline elements only occupy the space necessary to contain their content. They also do not create line breaks before or after themselves.
Block elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available within their parent container. They create line breaks before and after themselves.
Inline-block elements are a hybrid of inline and block elements, allowing them to have width, height, and other box properties while still being able to sit beside other elements horizontally.
