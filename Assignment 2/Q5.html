<!-- How is Border-box different from Content Box? -->

	Difference between box-sizing & content-box
Content Box:
With box-sizing: content-box, the width and height of an element are calculated based on its content box alone.
The width and height specified for an element in CSS represent the dimensions of the content box.
Any padding or border added to the element is added to the specified width and height, increasing the overall size of the element.

Border Box:
With box-sizing: border-box, the width and height of an element are calculated including its content, padding, and border.
The width and height specified for an element in CSS represent the dimensions of the border box.
The padding and border are included within the specified width and height, so they do not increase the overall size of the element.
