<!-- What is VW/VH ? -->
VW (viewport width) and VH (viewport height) are units of measurement in CSS that allow you to specify sizes relative to the viewport dimensions or to the screen in which our webpage is displayed.
The main difference between VW/VH and PX is that VW/VH are relative units that scale with the viewport size, while PX is an absolute unit that remains fixed regardless of the viewport dimensions.
