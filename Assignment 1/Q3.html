In HTML, there is a distinction between tags and elements. Here's how they differ:

HTML Tags: HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML document. They are used to define and mark up specific parts of the content. Tags are represented by opening and closing angle brackets ("<" and ">") and surround an element or a portion of the document. For example, <h1>, <p>, <div>, <a>, and <img> are all examples of HTML tags. Tags can have attributes that provide additional information or modify the behavior of the element.

HTML Elements: HTML elements consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The opening tag represents the start of the element and is denoted by the tag name enclosed in angle brackets. The closing tag represents the end of the element and is similar to the opening tag, but with a forward slash ("/") before the tag name. The content of the element is the text or other nested elements between the opening and closing tags
