Semantic tags in HTML are a set of elements that provide meaning and structure to the content within a web page. These tags are specifically designed to describe the type of content they enclose, rather than just indicating how the content should be styled. They convey the semantic or meaningful structure of the document.

Some commonly used semantic tags in HTML5 include <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>, <figure>, and <figcaption>, among others.
